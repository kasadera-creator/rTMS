# cleanup_report

- Moved old virtualenv:
  - `venv` has been isolated into `_attic/venv_old/` earlier in the process (was already removed from working tree).
  - Reason: keep `.venv` as the active environment and avoid tracking generated venv files in Git.

- Moved DOCX template:
  - `rtms_app/templates_docs/brainsway_sae_template.docx` -> `docs/templates/brainsway_sae_template.docx`
  - Updated reference in `rtms_app/views.py` to use `settings.BASE_DIR, "docs", "templates", "brainsway_sae_template.docx"`.
  - Reason: keep project generated/static templates under `docs/` to separate editable assets from app code.

- Gitignore / tracked files:
  - `.gitignore` updated to include `*.log` and `.pytest_cache/` (and earlier entries for `staticfiles/`, `__pycache__/`, `.DS_Store`, `venv/`, `.venv/`, etc.).
  - If large generated files remain tracked (e.g. `venv`), consider `git rm -r --cached` for those paths in a follow-up.

- What I left in place and why:
  - Project root `static/` retained because `STATICFILES_DIRS` references it.
  - `staticfiles/` remains in `.gitignore` because it is produced by `collectstatic`.

- Next recommended actions:
  - Run `git status` and review staged changes before committing.
  - Manually verify `/admin` and `/app/dashboard` after starting the server.
  - If `venv` is still tracked in Git history, consider removing it from the repository using `git rm -r --cached venv` and committing.
